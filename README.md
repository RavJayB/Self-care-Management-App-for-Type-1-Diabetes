# Self-care-Management-App-for-Type-1-Diabetes
The two leading causes of type 1 (T1D) diabetes are chronic pancreatic beta-cell dysfunction and insulin insufficiency. Because of this, persons with type 1 diabetes need to manage their disease constantly in order to maintain good blood glucose levels. Failure to do so may lead to adverse glycemic events with both short- and long-term consequences. This study will develop a smart mobile application to treat type 1 diabetes with the aid of machine learning. The main objective of this app is to give daily insulin dosages, along with meal plans and workout recommendations. Also, since most of the patients who suffer from type 1 diabetes are between 10 to 14 years old, this app focuses on allowing them and their caregivers a space to engage with their fellow diabetes patients through a peer support portal. In addition, this App has also focused on creating a knowledge hub for type 1 diabetes patients to gain knowledge about this chronic disease.
